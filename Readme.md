## Fourth activity WebGL.
## Objective: Do the following activities

1. Go through the tutorial on textures and WebGL. You have the material in the virtual classroom. The mesh.py file under the pdf allows to correctly generate the information of the static meshes with texture coordinates. You have both the link to the starting project (only until collisions) and the final resulting project. For the incorporation of the textures it is necessary to correct the component Blazor.Expansions.Canvas. In the pdf of the tutorial, in its appendix I explain how to do it.

2. Incorporate your results from activities 1 and 2 into the project.

Once the Blazor.Expansions.Canvas component has been corrected, we will follow the tutorial through the pdf resulting in the textures of the cubes, but we are also asked to incorporate what was done in the previous practices of the subject.

Among these activities we have to incorporate greater ranges of movement to the ship.

To complete we add the shadows as we had in the previous activity. What differentiates this activity from the other one is that in this one we use a task called shadowOperations, which is called in the Draw task. Its functionality is quite similar to that offered by ActorDependentOperations, which is already defined in the project.

To apply the textures finally we must modify the level.json file
